DONE|God will make a way
PENDING|Where there seems to be no way
PENDING|He works in a way, we cannot see
PENDING|He will make a way for me
DONE|He will be my guide
PENDING|Hold me closely to His side
PENDING|With love and strength for each new day
PENDING|He will make a way He will make a way
DONE|By a roadway in the wilderness, He'll lead me
PENDING|Rivers in the desert will I see
PENDING|Heaven and earth will fade, but His word will still remain
PENDING|And He will do something new today
